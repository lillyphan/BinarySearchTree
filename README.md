# BinarySearchTree

BinarySearchTree is a Java class that creates a binary search tree from scratch. It utilizes Node objects (from Node.java) as its basic data unit. BST is a data structure that stores a collection of elements in a binary-sorted fashion in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the nodeâ€™s key and vice versa for the right subtree.
